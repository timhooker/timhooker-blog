You can manage your content by signing in to the admin area at `<your blog URL>/ghost/`. When you arrive, you can select this post from a list on the left and see a preview of it on the right. Click the little pencil icon at the top of the preview to edit this post and read the next section!\n\n## Getting Started\n\nGhost uses something called Markdown for writing. Essentially, it's a shorthand way to manage your post formatting as you write!\n\nWriting in Markdown is really easy. In the left hand panel of Ghost, you simply write as you normally would. Where appropriate, you can use *shortcuts* to **style** your content. For example, a list:\n\n* Item number one\n* Item number two\n    * A nested item\n* A final item\n\nor with numbers!\n\n1. Remember to buy some milk\n2. Drink the milk\n3. Tweet that I remembered to buy the milk, and drank it\n\n### Links\n\nWant to link to a source? No problem. If you paste in a URL, like http://ghost.org - it'll automatically be linked up. But if you want to customise your anchor text, you can do that too! Here's a link to [the Ghost website](http://ghost.org). Neat.\n\n### What about Images?\n\nImages work too! Already know the URL of the image you want to include in your article? Simply paste it in like this to make it show up:\n\n![The Ghost Logo](https://ghost.org/images/ghost.png)\n\nNot sure which image you want to use yet? That's ok too. Leave yourself a descriptive placeholder and keep writing. Come back later and drag and drop the image in to upload:\n\n![A bowl of bananas](http://)\n\n\n### Quoting\n\nSometimes a link isn't enough, you want to quote someone on what they've said. Perhaps you've started using a new blogging platform and feel the sudden urge to share their slogan? A quote might be just the way to do it!\n\n> Ghost - Just a blogging platform\n\n### Working with Code\n\nGot a streak of geek? We've got you covered there, too. You can write inline `<code>` blocks really easily with back ticks. Want to show off something more comprehensive? 4 spaces of indentation gets you there.\n\n    .awesome-thing {\n        display: block;\n        width: 100%;\n    }\n\n### Ready for a Break? \n\nThrow 3 or more dashes down on any new line and you've got yourself a fancy new divider. Aw yeah.\n\n---\n\n### Advanced Usage\n\nThere's one fantastic secret about Markdown. If you want, you can write plain old HTML and it'll still work! Very flexible.\n\n<input type=\"text\" placeholder=\"I'm an input field!\" />\n\nThat should be enough to get you started. Have fun - and let us know what you think :)",

I was in a place where my family needed me to find work. My old career just wasn't going to work for us any more. I guess that's another conversation for another day but let's leave it at this.

Which brings me to my next point:\n\n##No one can give you a career\n\nSome of your classmates won't study until the day class begins. They will wait to study. They will wait to look for a job. They will be in a world of hurt.\n>Job guarantees are a myth\n\nSome code schools have job guarantees. When I enrolled at The Iron Yard they had just scrapped their job guarantee. That was totally fine by me. **Job guarantees are a myth**. I mean it. You don't always get what you earned. Sometimes you get what you didn't earn. Nothing in your life will ever truly be guaranteed.\n\nHere's the truth of the situation. I was going to be a developer. You might imagine I was ever so pleased someone would make the process more doable. If I had to slug through a formal degree I would. However, code school meant that I didn't have to.\n\nWhen I enrolled in code school I basically hired a very expensive tutor. I also was given a strong advocate in getting a job. Still, I paid them. \n\nAt some point you may say 'I'm doing this thing my teacher made me do'. Wrong! You wanted to go to code school. You are doing what you wanted. There's no degree at the end of the rainbow, only skills learned.\n\n// Disclaimer: I did everything I was asked to do and so should you.\n\nI was the one who was working, my family was footing the bill, and I was the one picking up the pieces if it failed. No one gave me this career.\n\n##I couldn't actually do it.\nThere is a sense in which you are paying into a bucket that may not pay out. You have no clue what the end result will be.\n\nFor example: My car broke down in the worst sort of way in the middle of the cohort. I was driving an hour both ways to get to school and my car died. The bill to fix my car was nearly $4,000. That could have been the end of my schooling.\n\nWhat I should have titled this section was, *\"I couldn't actually do it alone\"*. First and foremost I prayed a lot. If you don't believe in God you may not relate. In my eyes, every dollar in my bank account came from God's provision out of His love for me. He never left me, never forgot about me... He never will.\n\nI also couldn't have done it without my family. They financially helped out *a lot*. I had to pay for not just school but also the bills all the way through. I would have maxed out all my credit and still not made it if not for them. \n\nOn top of that my parents offered me a place to crash when I was too tired to drive home, warm meals, tea before bed, and never gave me a hard time when I ignored them so I could work.\n\n##My wife was in code school\nHere's a little nugget for you if you're married. Whatever you do, whatever you pay for, your spouse does and pays for too. We had a frank talk about me being completely M.I.A. for 12 weeks before I signed the contract to go to school. \n\nI did my best to pitch in when I was home to give my family any support I could.

            "markdown": "#We have a problem\nThis post is a rant. I think we have a problem. This post is aimed at the time-strapped developer who is pushing through, trying to support a family. It's hard and you do what you have to for survival.\n\n###Abstractions\nAs a rule, abstractions are great. I really love them and use them in my own work whenever possible. I'll paraphrase here but an abstraction is when you take a bit of code and give it a name that makes sense. It's like going to the store. In order to the store, you go outside, open the car door, get in the car, drive to the store ... etc. So there are a number of steps and depending on how you decide to organize it you might just abstract all of those steps into on big step. You'll just say go to the store...\n```\nfunction goToStore() {\n  ... things we to go to the store.\n};\n```\n\nThis pattern can be really helpful  when giving a new developer a 30,000 ft. view of your code. It is also really helpful when someone wants to extend the functionality of your application.\n\nWe love abstractions.\n\n###Abstractions gone wrong\nHere is how an abstraction becomes and obstruction: What happens when you have learned the abstraction but only the abstraction? What happens when the abstraction is so full of its own conventions and challenges that you are only learning how to work the abstraction? \n\nFor example: You can conceivably learn how to create a lot of interesting functionality in WordPress but not actually have a clue how to set up an API, do a SQL call, or really program at all. I'm saying you could have been creating websites for years and have no real clue how to actually make a website outside of your CMS.\n\nIn fact, it's pretty amazing how much you can do without knowing what you're doing at all.

            "html": "<h1 id=\"wehaveaproblem\">We have a problem</h1>\n\n<p>This post is a rant. I think we have a problem. This post is aimed at the time-strapped developer who is pushing through, trying to support a family. It's hard and you do what you have to for survival.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"abstractions\">Abstractions</h3>\n\n<p>As a rule, abstractions are great. I really love them and use them in my own work whenever possible. I'll paraphrase here but an abstraction is when you take a bit of code and give it a name that makes sense. It's like going to the store. In order to the store, you go outside, open the car door, get in the car, drive to the store ... etc. So there are a number of steps and depending on how you decide to organize it you might just abstract all of those steps into on big step. You'll just say go to the store...  </p>\n\n<pre><code>function goToStore() {  \n  ... things we to go to the store.\n};\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This pattern can be really helpful  when giving a new developer a 30,000 ft. view of your code. It is also really helpful when someone wants to extend the functionality of your application.</p>\n\n<p>We love abstractions.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"abstractionsgonewrong\">Abstractions gone wrong</h3>\n\n<p>Here is how an abstraction becomes and obstruction: What happens when you have learned the abstraction but only the abstraction? What happens when the abstraction is so full of its own conventions and challenges that you are only learning how to work the abstraction? </p>\n\n<p>For example: You can conceivably learn how to create a lot of interesting functionality in WordPress but not actually have a clue how to set up an API, do a SQL call, or really program at all. I'm saying you could have been creating websites for years and have no real clue how to actually make a website outside of your CMS.</p>\n\n<p>In fact, it's pretty amazing how much you can do without knowing what you're doing at all. You just take the code and hack at it until it does what you want.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"tyrannyoftheurgent\">Tyranny of the Urgent</h3>\n\n<p>So we now, I hope, see the problem.

            "markdown": "#Oh Ship!\n*That's what you **yell** when gulp stops working...  kinda*\n\nOk, so your build broke. What now?\n\n####Did you run npm install?\nWhen your stereo doesn't turn on, the first thing you wanna check is if it's plugged in. For all intents and purposes, gulp *runs* on its local dependencies. When you type npm install it will look for a file called ```package.json```.\n\nInside that file you'll see something like this\n\n```\n{\n  \"name\": \"banner\",\n  \"version\": \"0.0.0\",\n  \"bannerSize\": \"728x90\",\n  \"description\": \"An HTML banner\",\n  \"main\": \"index.html\",\n  \"keywords\": [\n    \"banner\",\n    \"html\"\n  ],\n  \"devDependencies\": {\n    \"del\": \"^1.2.0\",\n    \"gulp\": \"^3.9.0\",\n    \"gulp-connect\": \"^2.2.0\",\n    \"gulp-filesize\": \"0.0.6\",\n    \"gulp-header\": \"^1.2.2\",\n    \"gulp-minify-html\": \"^1.0.4\",\n    \"gulp-minify-inline\": \"^0.1.1\",\n    \"gulp-open\": \"^1.0.0\",\n    \"gulp-rename\": \"^1.2.2\",\n    \"gulp-sass\": \"^2.0.4\",\n    \"gulp-uglify\": \"^1.2.0\",\n    \"gulp-util\": \"^3.0.6\",\n    \"gulp-watch\": \"^4.3.4\",\n    \"gulp-zip\": \"^3.0.2\",\n    \"run-sequence\": \"^1.1.2\"\n  },\n  \"dependencies\": {}\n}\n\n```\nYou can do **A LOT** with npm but at it's core, and what you need to know is that when you type ```npm install```, it will go through all of the properties of devDependencies and dependencies and install them by their package name. You'll also notice to the right that there's a version number like so: ```\"gulp-sass\": \"^2.0.4\"```. So it's looking for a dependency name gulp-sass and the version starts with 2.0.4. If it said ```^2.0``` then it would give you any version of gulp sass that starts with 2.0.  \n\nfor example: 2.1.0, 2.2.1, 2.3.0... and so on.\n\nOnce you run ```npm install``` all of the dependencies will be downloaded into a folder called **node_modules** and node will look there first for any dependencies it needs to run. \n\n*NOTE: If node can't find what it's looking for in your project's node_modules folder, there is also a global node_modules folder normally found in /user/bin/.*\n\n####How Tasks work\nIt's important to have at least a general idea of how a gulp task works in order to be able to fix or alter it to your needs.\n\nGulp is a task runner so when you write a gulp build you create a series of tasks that get run in a certain order. So you'll say\n\ngulp please do these things:\n\n* find all my images and copy them into the destination folder\n* convert all my sass files into css and copy them too\n* find all my javascript files and look for errors\n* combine all my js files into one big fat file\n* watch for changes and then do it all again \n* (maybe even refresh your browser for you)\n\nHere's how you set it up... and it's pretty easy. Just head over to [npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/) and choose a task you wanna setup. Let's just look at the [gulp-sass](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-sass) module as sass compilation seems to be a common thing we use gulp for. They actually give you the task and how to use it.\n\n```\n'use strict';\n \nvar gulp = require('gulp');\nvar sass = require('gulp-sass');\n \ngulp.task('sass', function () {\n  return gulp.src('./sass/**/*.scss')\n    .pipe(sass().on('error', sass.logError))\n    .pipe(gulp.dest('./css'));\n});\n \ngulp.task('sass:watch', function () {\n  gulp.watch('./sass/**/*.scss', ['sass']);\n});\n```\nAt the top of the file we have two declarations.\n```\nvar gulp = require('gulp');\nvar sass = require('gulp-sass');\n```\nThe basically tell node to look for some resources called gulp and gulp-sass. If you leave this out... KABOOM. Nothing works.\n\nNext we do the most basic setup and tell gulp we have a task and give it a name. It's just a function really. Pretty simple.\n```\ngulp.task('sass', function () { //do something });\n```\nSo now when we run ``gulp sass`` gulp will look inside the \"sass\" folder and all it's subfolders for any files ending in .scss and put all the results in a folder called \"css\".\n\nIf you then run ``gulp sass:watch`` (the second task) gulp will do something else cool. Gulp has a cool feature called ``watch`` and it's basically an event listener. We're saying to gulp, watch everything in the sass folder and its subfolders. If a file is changed in any way, run the sass task.\n\nSo you may ask, how is it that we can just run ``gulp`` without an argument. All you have to do is setup a default task and give that task a few other tasks to run. You can do that like this\n```\ngulp.task('default', ['sass', 'sass:watch']);\n```\nNow the default task will run both of the other tasks in sequence. If you're interested, that little array I added are tasks that should run BEFORE the default task. There's no declared callback for this task so it just runs those tasks we've declared and that's it.\n\n####Live Reloading\nThe most common package we use for this is browsersync. If you wanna know more about it you can checkout [browsersync](https://www.browsersync.io/)'s website where they have a bunch of recipes to brew up your own or check out my blog post on it [here](http://timhookerdesign.com/and-then-it-hit-me/).\n####Installing Packages\n\nYou may notice the npm install command runs into errors from time to time. There are a lot of different reasons why this might occur but you could try reinstalling the plugin. Since we'll need this later for a specific issue we've run into I'll run you through it. \n\nGo ahead and checkout [npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/) and just look for the package you want to install. Once you find it you'll want to not only install it to your **node_modules** folder but also into you **package.json** file as a dependency.\n\nLocal/Project Install:\nThere are two common sorts of modules we can add: dependencies and your dev dependencies. Dev dependencies are just the ones we need for developing a website and the other sort are for production environments. Since we're using gulp, it's almost certain that all we'll need are dev dependencies.\n\n*for dev install like this:* ```npm install -save-dev <package_name>```\n\nIf you want to install for a live project like an express server, just use -save\n\nGlobal Install:\nThis can be helpful if you just want to install node-sass or gulp and don't want to bother with a package.json file with all the crazy node_module business. \n\ninstall like this ```npm install -g <package_name>```\n\n####SASS BLEW UP\n\nYour errors will range from a nasty message in the console accompanied by sass not compiling to a completely empty folder where your css, js, and html files should be.\n\nTake a look at your error output and that will lead you.\n\nEXAMPLE 1:\n```\n/node_modules/node-sass/lib/index.js:22\n    throw new Error('`libsass` bindings not found. Try reinstalling `node-sass`?');\n    ^\n```\n\nIf you have a gulp, grunt, or really any node-sass build from early 2015 or before you may be able to install gulp but end up with errors. The problem is that there was a big move away from compiling sass with ruby to using lib-sass instead. If all of that is jibber-jabber to you, just understand that the new way is faster but doesn't play nice with compass or older sass builds. \n\nWhat you need to know here is that node-sass isn't used directly by gulp. What you need is the latest version of gulp-sass which USES node-sass. \n\n1. Go into your package.json file and delete the entire line with gulp-sass in it (ex. ```\"gulp-sass\": \"^1.0.0\",```). \n2. Just to be safe, I would delete your node_modules folder entirely by typing in the terminal: ```rm -rf node_modules```. \n3. Install the latest gulp-sass ```npm install --save-dev gulp-sass``` \n4. install the rest of our friends with ```npm install```.\n\nEXAMPLE 2: \n```\nError in plugin 'sass'\nMessage:\n    dev/style.scss\nError: Undefined variable: \"$badVariable\".\n        on line 60 of stdin\n>>     color: $badVariable;\n   -----------^\n```\nThis is an easy one to fix but if you don't check your terminal you will be really confused. Sass was nice enough to tell us that in our style.scss file on line 60, you have a mistake in your sass. Here, we've referenced a variable that hasn't been defined. Fix your sass by either including the file where that variable is defined, by defining the variable, or by removing that line.\n\nEXAMPLE 3:\n```\n2 errors\n{ [Error: ../skin/frontend/themename/src/scss/_framework.scss\nError: File to import not found or unreadable: compass-libsass/compass\";\n```\nThis one is easy as well but this is specific to a dependency we've been using. We're missing a file in the compass-libsass folder that because of git issues has not downloaded and SASS can't find it. This is a patch so we can use libsass to compile our compass build for what turns out to be a Magento site. The files can be found at https://github.com/Igosuki/compass-mixins or on npm. Modify the _framework.scss file to point to the right file and expose the compass mixins.\n\n####Error: listen EADDRINUSE\n```\nevents.js:141\n      throw er; // Unhandled 'error' event\n      ^\n\nError: listen EADDRINUSE :::8889\n```\nThis is such a common error I thought I'd mention it directly. You have two gulp builds running both trying to use the same port. Shut one down or change the port it's trying to use. \n\nex. change localhost:8000 to localhost:3000\n\n####A FEW OTHER GOTCHAS\nSo you've gone through everything above and maybe you're getting strange errors saying something odd about compass plugins or a ruby version not being present. We used to use Ruby for a lot of source compiling instead of node. You will probably see less of this going forward but expect it inside of certain php builds that use compass such as older versions of the Omega Theme for Drupal.\n\nLook for a file called ```Gemfile```. This is a lot like our package.json file but you'll need to use [Bundler](http://bundler.io/) to fix it. If you don't have bundler you can install it with ```gem install bundler```. To install all the gems navigate into the same directory as the Gemfile and type ```bundle install```.\n\nIf you get an error saying the correct version of ruby isn't present then this may be a little harder to fix. Either in the ```Gemfile``` itself or in a file named one of the following ```ruby-version```, ```.rvmrc```, or  ```.versions.conf```. I use [homebrew](http://brew.sh/) and [rbenv](http://rbenv.org/) to keep up with all of the versions. Here's a nice tutorial on it that should still work but just do the steps before the git setup: https://gorails.com/setup/osx/10.11-el-capitan\n\n####In Closing\nOn many teams I would be considered a junior engineer based on my experience level. If you find this helpful, great! If not, let me know how I can improve! Thanks!",

If all of that is jibber-jabber to you, just understand that the new way is faster but doesn't play nice with compass or older sass builds. </p>\n\n<p>What you need to know here is that node-sass isn't used directly by gulp. What you need is the latest version of gulp-sass which USES node-sass. </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Go into your package.json file and delete the entire line with gulp-sass in it (ex. <code>\"gulp-sass\": \"^1.0.0\",</code>).  </li>\n<li>Just to be safe, I would delete your node_modules folder entirely by typing in the terminal: <code>rm -rf node_modules</code>.  </li>\n<li>Install the latest gulp-sass <code>npm install --save-dev gulp-sass</code>  </li>\n<li>install the rest of our friends with <code>npm install</code>.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>EXAMPLE 2:  </p>\n\n<pre><code>Error in plugin 'sass'  \nMessage:  \n    dev/style.scss\nError: Undefined variable: \"$badVariable\".  \n        on line 60 of stdin\n&gt;&gt;     color: $badVariable;\n   -----------^\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This is an easy one to fix but if you don't check your terminal you will be really confused. Sass was nice enough to tell us that in our style.scss file on line 60, you have a mistake in your sass. Here, we've referenced a variable that hasn't been defined. Fix your sass by either including the file where that variable is defined, by defining the variable, or by removing that line.</p>\n\n<p>EXAMPLE 3:  </p>\n\n<pre><code>2 errors  \n{ [Error: ../skin/frontend/themename/src/scss/_framework.scss\nError: File to import not found or unreadable: compass-libsass/compass\";  \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This one is easy as well but this is specific to a dependency we've been using. We're missing a file in the compass-libsass folder that because of git issues has not downloaded and SASS can't find it. This is a patch so we can use libsass to compile our compass build for what turns out to be a Magento site. The files can be found at <a href=\"https://github.com/Igosuki/compass-mixins\">https://github.com/Igosuki/compass-mixins</a> or on npm. Modify the _framework.scss file to point to the right file and expose the compass mixins.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"errorlisteneaddrinuse\">Error: listen EADDRINUSE</h4>\n\n<pre><code>events.js:141  \n      throw er; // Unhandled 'error' event\n      ^\n\nError: listen EADDRINUSE :::8889  \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This is such a common error I thought I'd mention it directly. You have two gulp builds running both trying to use the same port. Shut one down or change the port it's trying to use. </p>\n\n<p>ex. change localhost:8000 to localhost:3000</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"afewothergotchas\">A FEW OTHER GOTCHAS</h4>\n\n<p>So you've gone through everything above and maybe you're getting strange errors saying something odd about compass plugins or a ruby version not being present. We used to use Ruby for a lot of source compiling instead of node. You will probably see less of this going forward but expect it inside of certain php builds that use compass such as older versions of the Omega Theme for Drupal.</p>\n\n<p>Look for a file called <code>Gemfile</code>. This is a lot like our package.json file but you'll need to use <a href=\"http://bundler.io/\">Bundler</a> to fix it. If you don't have bundler you can install it with <code>gem install bundler</code>. To install all the gems navigate into the same directory as the Gemfile and type <code>bundle install</code>.</p>\n\n<p>If you get an error saying the correct version of ruby isn't present then this may be a little harder to fix. Either in the <code>Gemfile</code> itself or in a file named one of the following <code>ruby-version</code>, <code>.rvmrc</code>, or  <code>.versions.conf</code>. I use <a href=\"http://brew.sh/\">homebrew</a> and <a href=\"http://rbenv.org/\">rbenv</a> to keep up with all of the versions. Here's a nice tutorial on it that should still work but just do the steps before the git setup: <a href=\"https://gorails.com/setup/osx/10.11-el-capitan\">https://gorails.com/setup/osx/10.11-el-capitan</a></p>\n\n<h4 id=\"inclosing\">In Closing</h4>\n\n<p>On many teams I would be considered a junior engineer based on my experience level. If you find this helpful, great! If not, let me know how I can improve! Thanks!</p>",
